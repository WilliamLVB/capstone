Capstone Project

This project is about high school accreditation in Indonesia.
The government of Indonesia aims to improve education quality & mandated National Accreditation Organization
to register, audit, and certify schools in Indonesia.
The grade ranges from A (being the best) to E (requires a lot of improvements).


The accreditation process itself is a lengthy process & consumes resources.
Being accredited as 'A' school give an economic leverage for schools because every parent wants their children
to study in the best school.

In the accreditation process, we should expect some 'error' (be it fraud or pure mistake).


The objectives of this project are:
* To detect if there is an anomaly in the accreditation process for a certain high school &
to find the determinant features.
* To find the determinant features of high school quality. For this purpose, we will introduce the national exam score.
